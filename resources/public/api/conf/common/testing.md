You can use the Sandbox environment to <a href="https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/testing">test this API</a>. You can test different scenarios in the Sandbox by passing the Gov-Test-Scenario header. The Sandbox also allows you to perform <a href="https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/documentation/how-to-integrate.html#sandbox-testing">stateful and dynamic testing</a> for some APIs. The ‘Test data’ section under each endpoint explains the test scenarios that can be simulated.

If you have a specific testing need that is not supported in the Sandbox, <a href="https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/support">contact our Software Developers Support Team</a>. Some endpoints may be marked \[test only\], which means that they are not available for use in Production and may change.
